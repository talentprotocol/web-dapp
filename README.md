# Talent Protocol

> Support talent you believe in and be rewarded when they succeed.

Talent Protocol is a decentralized platform where talent can create a personal token, and where supporters can make angel investments in someone's career to become a part of their journey.

## Installing / Getting started

Check our [Onboarding Guide](https://www.notion.so/talentprotocol/Onboarding-89126b0828154be396951bc22267b0eb)

### Git approach

Our developments are made in feature branches. In order to create a feature branch you should create a new one from the `dev` branch.

We also recommend you to setup our pre-commit hook. In order to do that you just need to run once:

`cp .githooks/pre-commit .git/hooks`

After that `make lint` will run before each commit for the staged files.
